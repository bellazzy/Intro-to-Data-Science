    "* Answer in the cells immediately below the problem statements. If a problem calls for code, a code cell will follow. If a problem calls for a text response, a Markdown cell will follow.\n",
    "* Your code should include some comments. Insufficient commentary may result in loss of points. But you do not necessarily need to comment every line or problem. Further guidelines:\n",
    "    - If the the meaning of some line of code would be obvious to the average Python novice, you do not need to comment (e.g., you do not need to comment _import numpy_). \n",
    "    - If your code is moderately complex, you should comment (e.g., if you nest several functions in one line, you should comment). \n",
    "    - It may be proper to comment before a code block to describe generally what you are doing (e.g., you should comment before a function definition to explain the function and its parameters)."
